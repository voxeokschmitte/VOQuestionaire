Voxeo VoiceObjects Project VOQuestionaire

A questionaire application for VoiceObjects. 
A dynamic collection of questions is presented to the calller. The feedback is collected per question. 

In this repository you can find the VoiceObjects export file (questionaire.xml) as well as a sample collection, a SQL to get the Business Task data from your Infostore and the whole project documentation from the downloads section.

The main idea is to have a Collection object which contains all the questions and all additional information (TTS texts or audios, Grammars and finally the answers to the question).
Then we use a Loop object to walk through the Collection. Each question is presented to the caller and the answer is stored into the Collection.
When the questionnaire is done the whole collection (or only the answers) can be sent to any backend.
Additionally I have added some Business Tasks to the project which track the answers as well and the completion of the questionnaire.

To make this a real-world example it would be needed to dynamically load the Collection data (e.g. from a Connector) and to store the resulting collection to a backend (also with a Connector).
